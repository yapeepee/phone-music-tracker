## üéµ Tempo Detection Implementation Details

### Overview
Implemented real-time tempo detection that handles musicians playing at different multiples of the metronome tempo (e.g., 60 BPM metronome but playing at 120 BPM notes).

### Key Features:
1. **Multiple Detection**: Automatically detects and adjusts for common tempo ratios (0.25x, 0.5x, 1x, 2x, 4x)
2. **Accuracy Calculation**: Measures timing consistency as a percentage (0-100%)
3. **Visual Feedback**: AngryMetronome face changes based on tempo accuracy
4. **Accuracy Ring**: Visual indicator shows accuracy percentage around metronome

### Technical Implementation:
- Uses expo-av Audio.Recording API for microphone access
- Analyzes inter-beat intervals to calculate tempo
- Adjusts for tempo multiples with 15% tolerance
- Updates UI every 100ms for responsive feedback

### Files Modified:
- `/services/tempo-detection.service.ts`: Core tempo detection logic
- `/screens/student/NewSessionScreen.tsx`: Integration with practice session
- `/components/practice/AngryMetronome.tsx`: Visual feedback based on tempo

### Future Enhancements:
- Native module for real-time FFT analysis
- Instrument-specific detection modes
- Machine learning for improved beat detection

## üìä Progress Tracking Protocol

Throughout development, continuously update:
1. **API_PATHS_AND_VARIABLES.md** - Document EVERY endpoint/variable
2. **CLAUDE_ACTIVE.md** - Add new critical patterns discovered
3. **This file** - Mark completed tasks and adjust priorities
4. **Todo list** - Use TodoWrite tool for task tracking

## üîí Security & Performance Phase (2025-07-06)

   - Auth: 5 logins/minute, 3 registrations/hour
   - Forum: 5 posts/minute, 10 comments/minute, 30 votes/minute
   - Video: 5 uploads/hour
   - Partner discovery: 10 requests/minute
4. **Redis Caching** - Created caching infrastructure with cache invalidation patterns

### Files Modified:

## üîß Forum Greenlet Error Fix (2025-01-07) ‚úÖ COMPLETE

### Issue
"Failed to load posts: [AxiosError: Request failed with status code 500]" - Forum endpoints failing with greenlet errors

### Root Causes Identified & Fixed:
1. **Pydantic ValidationError** - Missing fields in related_piece objects
   - Added: owner_teacher_id, estimated_mastery_sessions, is_archived, archived_at
   
2. **SQLAlchemy Greenlet Error** - Lazy loading in async context
   - Error occurred when accessing `db_post.tags.append(tag)`
   - Fixed by using direct insert into association table instead of ORM relationship

### Solution Details:
```python
# OLD - Causes greenlet error
db_post.tags.append(tag)

# NEW - Works correctly
await self.db.execute(
    insert(post_tags).values([
        {"post_id": db_post.id, "tag_id": tag_id}
        for tag_id in tag_ids
    ])
)
```

### Files Modified:
- `/backend/app/services/forum/forum_service.py` - Fixed tag handling, reordered commits
- `/backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/forum.py` - Re-enabled ForumService (removed temporary bypasses)

### Key Learnings:
1. Be careful with relationship access on newly created objects in async SQLAlchemy
2. Lazy loading can cause greenlet errors in async context
3. Direct table operations can be more reliable than ORM relationships
4. Commit order matters - committing parent before manipulating relationships helps

### Test Results:
- ‚úÖ All forum endpoints working (list, create, get single post)
- ‚úÖ Tag associations working correctly
- ‚úÖ Cache operations re-enabled and functioning
- ‚úÖ Comment creation and nested comments working
- ‚úÖ Post reload after commenting fixed

### Additional Fix (Same Day):
Fixed "failed to load post" error after creating comments by adding eager loading for nested comment relationships in ForumService.get_post(). The issue was similar - lazy loading of comment.children in async context.

### Additional Progress (2025-01-07):
Fixed "failed to load post" after creating comments:
- Added eager loading for nested comment relationships in ForumService.get_post()
- Fixed lazy loading of comment.children causing greenlet errors

### Service Migrations (2025-01-07):
Successfully migrated the following services to use BaseService:
1. **forum.service.ts** - Already using BaseService and camelCase
2. **video-api.service.ts** - Migrated from apiClient to BaseService
   - Updated interfaces: VideoResponse, VideoWithUrl to use camelCase
   - Fixed SessionDetailScreen.tsx to use durationSeconds, fileSizeBytes
3. **tag.service.ts** - Migrated from apiClient to BaseService
   - Updated interfaces: TagCreate, TagUpdate, PopularTag to use camelCase
   - Changed snake_case to camelCase: tag_type‚ÜítagType, opus_number‚ÜíopusNumber, etc.

### Service Migration (2025-01-08):
4. **schedule.service.ts** - Migrated from apiClient to BaseService
   - Extended BaseService with '/schedule' base path
   - Updated all API methods to use BaseService methods (get, post, put, delete)
   - Fixed query parameters: include_conflicts‚ÜíincludeConflicts, update_series‚ÜíupdateSeries, delete_series‚ÜídeleteSeries, days_ahead‚ÜídaysAhead
   - Updated helper methods to use camelCase properties: start_datetime‚ÜístartDatetime, end_datetime‚ÜíendDatetime
   - Fixed ScheduleScreen.tsx to use camelCase parameters in API calls
   - All interfaces were already using camelCase (no changes needed)

### Bug Fix: Teacher Students List Key Prop Error (2025-01-08)
Fixed "Each child in a list should have a unique key prop" error in StudentsListScreen:
- Added defensive handling for both camelCase and snake_case variable names from API
- Created StudentActivityFlexible type to handle both naming conventions
- Updated keyExtractor to handle userId, user_id, or fallback to index
- Added unique student filtering to prevent duplicate keys
- Updated all property access to check both camelCase and snake_case versions

Root cause: API transformation causing variable name inconsistencies between camelCase/snake_case

### Bug Fix: Student Profile Empty Data & Invalid Date (2025-01-08)
Fixed "invalid date" and empty data issues in StudentProfileScreen:
- Created StudentProfileFlexible and SessionResponseFlexible types to handle both naming conventions
- Added defensive property access for nested user data (student.user.fullName vs full_name)
- Fixed date formatting with validation check for invalid dates
- Updated all stats cards to check both camelCase and snake_case field names
- Added console logging for debugging API response structure
- Handled multiple possible data structure formats from API transformation

Root issues:
1. API transformation converting snake_case to camelCase inconsistently
2. Nested objects (student.user) not being accessed with proper fallbacks
3. Date fields being undefined or in wrong format
4. Teacher service still using old apiClient pattern while transformation is active

### Bug Fix: Teacher Session Detail Invalid Dates & Missing Data (2025-01-08)
Fixed "invalid date" and missing focus/tags in teacher's SessionDetailScreen:
- Created SessionResponseFlexible and FeedbackFlexible types to handle both naming conventions
- Fixed date validation with proper checks for invalid dates
- Updated all date displays to show "Date not available" for invalid dates
- Fixed focus display to show actual custom text (not enum-based icons)
- Fixed tag display to handle both string and object tag formats
- Added support for both camelCase and snake_case field access throughout
- Updated SessionResponse interface to include missing fields (durationMinutes, etc.)
- Added console logging for debugging API responses

Key changes:
1. Date fields: Check both startTime and start_time with validation
2. Focus: Simplified to show custom text with generic flag icon
3. Tags: Handle both string[] and object[] formats
4. Self rating: Check both selfRating and self_rating
5. Duration: Check both durationMinutes and duration_minutes

Root cause: Practice service using old apiClient with inconsistent field naming from API transformation

### Bug Fix: Session Creation Internal Server Error (2025-01-08)
Fixed "Internal Server Error" when creating practice session in student account:

**Root Cause Found:**
The backend SessionService.create_session was missing the target_tempo and practice_mode fields when creating a new session.

**Fixed:**
1. Updated SessionService.create_session to include target_tempo and practice_mode fields
2. Updated the session creation endpoint to include these fields in the response
3. Both fields were already in the database model and schemas

**Changes Made:**
- `/backend/app/services/practice/session_service.py` - Added target_tempo and practice_mode to session creation
- `/backend/app/api/v1/sessions.py` - Added these fields to the response dict

The session creation should now work correctly. The backend was expecting these fields but wasn't saving them to the database.

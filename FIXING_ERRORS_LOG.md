# Error Fixing Log

## Summary of Errors After Variable Name Transformation

### Root Cause
The primary issue was that after implementing the automatic API transformation system (snake_case to camelCase), many components and services were still using the old snake_case property names. This caused runtime errors when trying to access properties that no longer existed in their expected format.

### Errors Fixed

1. **ReputationBadge TypeError: Cannot read property 'toString' of undefined**
   - **Cause**: `points` parameter was undefined, and `formatPoints()` was calling `toString()` on it
   - **Fix**: 
     - Added defensive checks in `formatPoints()` to handle undefined/null values
     - Updated ReputationBadge interface to accept `points: number | undefined | null`
     - Updated LeaderboardScreen to use camelCase properties (`entry.reputationPoints` instead of `entry.reputation_points`)

2. **LeaderboardScreen Property Access Errors**
   - **Cause**: Still using snake_case properties after API transformation
   - **Fix**: Updated all property accesses:
     - `entry.user_id` → `entry.userId`
     - `entry.full_name` → `entry.fullName`
     - `entry.reputation_points` → `entry.reputationPoints`
     - `entry.reputation_level` → `entry.reputationLevel`

3. **VirtualizedList Key Warning**
   - **Cause**: Using array index as key in ForumListScreen tags rendering
   - **Fix**: Changed from `key={index}` to `key={tag}` to use the actual tag value

4. **CSS Gap Property Issues**
   - **Cause**: React Native doesn't support the `gap` CSS property in all versions
   - **Fix**: Removed `gap` properties and added explicit margins instead

## Lesson Learned

When implementing a large-scale transformation like snake_case to camelCase conversion, it's critical to:
1. Update ALL components that consume the transformed data
2. Add defensive checks for potentially undefined values
3. Test each screen thoroughly after transformation
4. Use TypeScript interfaces consistently to catch these errors at compile time

## Remaining Tasks

1. Continue migrating all services to use BaseService pattern
2. Update remaining components to use camelCase properties
3. Add more robust error handling and defensive checks
4. Consider adding runtime validation for API responses

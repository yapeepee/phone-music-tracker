# Forum Error Fix Summary

## Problem
"Failed to load posts: [AxiosError: Request failed with status code 500]"

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Pydantic Validation Error
Added missing fields to related_piece objects in forum.py:
- owner_teacher_id
- estimated_mastery_sessions  
- is_archived
- archived_at

### 2. Fixed Greenlet Error
Temporarily bypassed ForumService in:
- POST /forum/posts/ (create_post)
- GET /forum/posts/{id} (get_post)

## Results
âœ… All forum endpoints now working:
- GET /forum/posts/ - Lists posts
- POST /forum/posts/ - Creates posts
- GET /forum/posts/{id} - Gets single post with comments

## Next Steps
Need to fix ForumService permanently instead of bypassing it.

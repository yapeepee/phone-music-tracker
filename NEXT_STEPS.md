## 🚀 Immediate Next Steps

### ✅ Phase 4: Teacher Tools 👩‍🏫
Teacher tools are 100% complete! 🎉

### 🚧 Practice Focus System - IN PROGRESS (Complete Redesign) 🎼

**Updated Understanding (Critical Change):**
The user wants "practice focuses" to be:
- **Custom text reminders** created by students (NOT predefined options)
- **Specific to each piece** (e.g., "right hand sing more on second movement")
- **Clickable during practice** with micro-animations and count tracking
- **Can be marked complete** when no longer needs focus
- **Two types of summaries**:
  1. Session summary: What was clicked during THIS session
  2. Piece summary: Overall history when piece is archived/closed

**Current Implementation Status:**
- ✅ Backend already supports this via PracticeSegment model (just needs renaming)
- ✅ Click tracking already implemented
- ✅ Completion status already supported
- ❌ Currently in separate screen (needs to be in active session)
- ❌ No session summary
- ❌ No piece closure/archive functionality

**Updated Implementation Plan:**

### Phase 1: Backend & Model Updates ✅ COMPLETED
**Make practice sessions work without predefined focus:**
- [x] Make `focus` field optional in PracticeSession model ✅
- [x] Update API schemas to reflect optional focus ✅
- [x] Update frontend types (PracticeFocus optional) ✅
- [x] Update Redux slice to not require focus ✅
- [x] Update practice service API calls ✅
- [x] Applied database migration ✅

### Phase 2: UI Terminology & Restructure ✅ COMPLETED
**Rename and reorganize:**
- [x] Remove PracticeFocus enum from imports ✅
- [x] Remove selectedFocus state ✅
- [x] Rename all "segment" → "practice focus" in UI ✅
- [x] Practice focuses already in NewSessionScreen (no move needed) ✅
- [x] Add "Add New Focus" button during active session ✅
- [x] Create inline modal for adding new focuses ✅

### Phase 3: Enhanced Click Tracking & Animations ✅ COMPLETED
**Better user experience:**
- [x] Track session-specific clicks (not just total) ✅ 
- [x] Install animation packages: ✅
  - react-native-reanimated (already installed)
  - react-native-gesture-handler (already installed)
  - lottie-react-native (for celebrations) ✅
- [x] Add micro-animations: ✅
  - Scale bounce on click ✅
  - Ripple effect ✅
  - Number flip animation ✅
  - Completion celebration ✅
- [x] Show total click counts alongside today's clicks ✅

### Phase 4: Session Summary Modal ✅ COMPLETED
**Show summary before session ends:**
- [x] Create SessionSummaryModal component ✅
- [x] Track which focuses were clicked this session ✅
- [x] Show click counts per focus ✅
- [x] Display total duration ✅
- [x] Integrate into endSession flow ✅

### Phase 5: Piece Management & Archive ✅ COMPLETED
**Complete piece lifecycle:**
- [x] Add "Archive Piece" functionality ✅
- [x] Create PieceSummaryScreen showing: ✅
  - All focuses ever created ✅
  - Total clicks per focus ✅
  - Practice patterns over time ✅
  - Which focuses were completed ✅

### 🐌 Slow Practice Enforcer - DETAILED IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

**Current Progress**: ~60% Complete

#### ✅ Completed (Days 1-4):
1. **Click Count Display** (100% done):
   - Updated PracticeFocusCard and AnimatedPracticeFocusCard
   - Shows "Today | Total" format
   - Real-time updates working

2. **Backend Infrastructure** (100% done):
   - Database: target_tempo, practice_mode columns

   - API endpoints: All created and documented

3. **Core Components** (created but not integrated):
   - metronome.service.ts - Beat timing with drift correction
   - AngryMetronome.tsx - Emotional metronome (😊😐😠😡)
   - MeditationMode.tsx - Zen mode under 60 BPM

#### ❌ TODO (Days 5-7):

**Day 5: Points System & Basic Integration**
- [ ] Install packages:
  - react-native-sound (metronome sounds)
  - react-native-haptic-feedback (vibration)
  - react-native-linear-gradient (meditation visuals)
- [ ] Add to NewSessionScreen:

  - "Slow Practice Mode" toggle
  - Target tempo setting
- [ ] Connect metronome to practice session
- [ ] Display real-time points accumulation

**Day 6: Meditation Mode & Achievements**

- [ ] Achievement types:
  - "Zen Master" - 30 min meditation
  - "Patience Padawan" - 10 min under tempo
  - "Slow and Steady" - 7 day streak
  - "Tempo Discipline" - 100 points
- [ ] Achievement unlock animations (Lottie)
- [ ] Integrate MeditationMode activation

- [ ] Session tempo tracking during practice
- [ ] Post-session tempo statistics screen
- [ ] Points earned summary
- [ ] Achievement notifications
- [ ] Sound effects for metronome
- [ ] Haptic feedback on beats

#### Technical Implementation Details:

**NewSessionScreen Integration Points**:
1. Before session start:
   ```tsx
   {practiceMode === 'slow_practice' && (
     <TempoSettings
       targetTempo={targetTempo}
       onTempoChange={setTargetTempo}
     />
   )}
   ```

2. During session:
   ```tsx
   {isSessionActive && practiceMode === 'slow_practice' && (
     <>
       <AngryMetronome
         targetTempo={targetTempo}
         actualTempo={currentTempo}
         isPlaying={isPlaying}
       />
       {currentTempo < 60 && <MeditationMode bpm={currentTempo} isActive />}
     </>
   )}
   ```

3. Track tempo data:
   ```tsx
   useEffect(() => {
     if (isPlaying) {
       const interval = setInterval(() => {
         // Record tempo entry
         tempoService.recordTempoEntry(sessionId, {
           actual_tempo: currentTempo,
           target_tempo: targetTempo,
           is_under_tempo: currentTempo < targetTempo
         });
       }, 1000); // Every second
     }
   }, [isPlaying]);
   ```

**Points Calculation**:
- Under tempo: 1 point/minute
- 20%+ under: 2 points/minute  
- Meditation (<60 BPM): 3 points/minute

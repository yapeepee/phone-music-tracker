# ✅ Analytics API Implementation Complete

## Summary
Successfully created analytics API endpoints with careful attention to naming consistency and existing patterns.

## Implemented Endpoints

### 1. GET `/sessions/{session_id}/analytics`
- **Purpose**: Get analysis result for a specific practice session
- **Response**: Complete analysis scores and statistics
- **Access Control**: User can only access their own sessions

### 2. GET `/sessions/{session_id}/metrics`
- **Purpose**: Get time-series metrics for a session
- **Query Parameters**:
  - `metric_type`: Filter by specific metric (optional)
  - `start_time`: Start of time range (optional)
  - `end_time`: End of time range (optional)
- **Response**: Metrics grouped by type with timestamps

### 3. GET `/analytics/summary`
- **Purpose**: Get user's overall analytics summary
- **Query Parameters**:
  - `days`: Number of days to analyze (1-365, default: 30)
- **Response**: Average scores, improvement percentages, practice statistics

### 4. GET `/analytics/trends`
- **Purpose**: Get trend analysis for a specific metric
- **Query Parameters**:
  - `metric_type`: Type of metric to analyze (required)
  - `days`: Number of days to analyze (7-365, default: 30)
- **Response**: Daily/weekly averages with trend direction

## Key Design Decisions

### Naming Consistency
- Used existing pattern: `/sessions/{id}/sub-resource` for session-specific data
- Created new `/analytics/` prefix for cross-session analysis
- Maintained RESTful conventions throughout

### Avoided Duplicates
- Checked existing endpoints before creating new ones
- Reused existing models (PracticeMetrics, AnalysisResult)
- No creation of redundant paths or services

### SQL Fixes
- Fixed GROUP BY clause for PostgreSQL compatibility
- Used label aliases instead of full expressions

## Testing Results
All endpoints tested and working:
- ✅ Authentication working
- ✅ Empty results for test user (expected)
- ✅ SQL queries executing correctly
- ✅ Error handling in place

## Next Steps
1. Create frontend services to consume these endpoints
2. Build Victory Native charts for visualization
3. Create analytics dashboard screens
4. Add caching for performance optimization

## Lessons Learned
- Always check existing patterns before creating new ones
- Use consistent naming across the entire codebase
- Test with actual data to catch SQL issues early
- Document API changes immediately in API_PATHS_AND_VARIABLES.md

# 🎯 Video Upload - Final Fix Applied

## 🔍 Variable Consistency Issue Found (你說得對!)

You were absolutely right about variable consistency. The issue was:

### ❌ Path Mismatch
- **Frontend was calling**: `/api/v1/video-processing/upload-multipart/{sessionId}`
- **Backend expects**: `/api/v1/videos/upload-multipart/{sessionId}`
- **Reason**: I changed the path inconsistently

### ✅ Fixed
Updated `video-upload.service.ts` line 298:
```typescript
// Before (WRONG):
process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL + '/video-processing/upload'

// After (CORRECT):
process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL + '/videos/upload'
```

## 🚨 IMPORTANT: Reload Your App!

The fix is applied but your app is still using the old code. You must:

1. **Shake your phone** (or press Cmd+D in simulator)
2. **Press "Reload"** in the Expo menu
3. **Or restart Expo completely**:
   ```bash
   # Stop Expo (Ctrl+C)
   # Start again
   npm start
   ```

## 🧪 Verify Fix is Active

After reloading, the backend logs should show:
- ✅ Requests to `/api/v1/videos/upload-multipart/{sessionId}`
- ❌ NOT `/api/v1/video-processing/upload-multipart/{sessionId}`

## 📊 Complete Variable Consistency Check

### Frontend → Backend Path Mapping:
- Auth: `/api/v1/auth/*` ✅
- Sessions: `/api/v1/sessions/*` ✅
- Videos: `/api/v1/videos/*` ✅ (NOW FIXED)

### Session ID Consistency:
- Frontend: Sends timestamp IDs for offline sessions
- Backend: Accepts both UUID and timestamp formats ✅

### Field Name Consistency:
- Upload field: `video` ✅
- Session ID param: `session_id` ✅
- Response field: `video_url` ✅

## 🔍 How to Debug if Still Failing

```bash
# 1. Check what URL the app is calling
docker-compose logs -f backend | grep "POST"

# 2. Test the correct endpoint manually
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/videos/upload-multipart/test \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -F "video=@test.mp4"

# 3. Verify all services are running
docker-compose ps
```

## 🎯 Key Lesson

Always maintain consistency:
- Same variable names across frontend/backend
- Same URL paths in router definitions and service calls
- Same field names in requests/responses

Your video upload should work after reloading the app! 🚀

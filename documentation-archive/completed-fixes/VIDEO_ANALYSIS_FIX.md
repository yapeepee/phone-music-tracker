# 🎥 Video Analysis Fix - Type Mismatch Resolution

## 🔍 Problem Discovered

Videos were failing to be analyzed with the error:
```
column "id" is of type integer but expression is of type uuid
```

## 🎯 Root Cause

The Celery task `process_video` was defined with incorrect type annotations:
- Expected: `session_id: int`
- Actually received: UUID strings like `"79ceb493-156c-45a4-837b-9438b1923cee"`

This type mismatch caused:
1. Initial video processing to fail
2. Notification creation to fail when trying to notify about the failure
3. Cascading errors that prevented audio analysis from running

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. Updated Task Signatures

Changed all video processing tasks to accept UUIDs:

```python
# Before
def process_video(self, session_id: int, video_path: str, user_id: int, ...)

# After  
def process_video(self, session_id: Union[str, uuid.UUID], video_path: str, user_id: Union[str, uuid.UUID], ...)
```

### 2. Files Modified

- `/backend/app/tasks/video_tasks.py`:
  - Added `import uuid`
  - Updated all function signatures to accept `Union[str, uuid.UUID]`
  - Fixed UUID handling in notification creation

### 3. Restarted Services

```bash
docker-compose restart celery-worker
```

## 🧪 To Test the Fix

1. Upload a new video through the mobile app
2. Check Celery logs: `docker-compose logs -f celery-worker`
3. Monitor Flower dashboard: http://localhost:5555
4. Verify audio analysis completes successfully

## 📊 Expected Result

After uploading a video, you should see:
- Video transcoding to multiple qualities (360p, 720p, 1080p)
- Thumbnail generation
- Audio extraction
- **Audio analysis with tempo, pitch, dynamics metrics**
- Data stored in TimescaleDB
- Successful completion notification

## 🔄 Next Steps

1. Test a new video upload
2. Verify analysis data is stored in database
3. Create API endpoints to retrieve analytics data
4. Build mobile app dashboard to display metrics

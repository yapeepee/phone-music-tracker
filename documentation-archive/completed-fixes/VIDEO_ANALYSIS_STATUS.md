# 📊 Video Analysis Status Report

## ✅ What's Working

1. **Video Upload**: Successfully uploading videos to MinIO
   - Path: `videos/temp/user_{id}/session_{timestamp}_{filename}`
   - Your latest upload: 11MB video at 2:33 AM

2. **Video Processing Pipeline**:
   - ✅ Video transcoding to multiple qualities (360p, 720p, 1080p)
   - ✅ Thumbnail generation (5 thumbnails)
   - ✅ Audio extraction to MP3 format
   - ✅ Preview clip creation
   - ✅ All files stored in MinIO successfully

3. **UUID Type Fix**: The original error about UUID/integer mismatch has been fixed

## ❌ What's Not Working

1. **Audio Analysis Storage**: 
   - Analysis runs but fails to save metrics to TimescaleDB
   - Error: "Can't match sentinel values in result set"
   - Root cause: Batch insertion issue with composite primary keys

2. **Temporary Session Processing**:
   - Videos uploaded with timestamp IDs (like "1750991604496") don't trigger processing
   - Only database sessions with proper UUIDs trigger processing
   - This is by design - processing happens when session is synced

## 🔍 Current State

Your video (session_1750991604496) was:
- ✅ Uploaded successfully 
- ⏸️ Not processed (waiting for session sync)

Test session (79ceb493-156c-45a4-837b-9438b1923cee):
- ✅ Video processing completed
- ✅ All video files generated
- ❌ Audio analysis failed to save

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **To process your uploaded video**:
   - Sync the session from mobile app to create database record
   - OR manually create a database session and trigger processing

2. **To fix audio analysis**:
   - Fix batch insertion for TimescaleDB
   - May need to insert metrics one by one instead of batch

3. **To see processing in action**:
   - I can manually trigger processing for your video if you want
   - Or wait for session sync from mobile app

## 📝 Summary

Video processing is 90% working! The pipeline successfully:
- Processes videos
- Creates multiple qualities
- Extracts audio
- Generates thumbnails

Only the final step (saving audio analysis metrics) needs fixing.

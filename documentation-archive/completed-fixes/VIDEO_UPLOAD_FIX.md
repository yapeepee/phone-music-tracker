# 🎥 Video Upload Fix Summary

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### 1. crypto.getRandomValues() Error
- **Problem**: `uuid` library was trying to use Web Crypto API not available in React Native
- **Solution**: Added `react-native-get-random-values` polyfill at the top of App.tsx

### 2. Missing TUS Upload Endpoints
- **Problem**: Frontend was using TUS protocol but backend didn't have TUS endpoints
- **Solution**: Created complete TUS v1.0.0 implementation in backend

## ✅ What Was Done

### Frontend Changes
```javascript
// App.tsx - Added at the very top
import 'react-native-get-random-values';
```

### Backend Changes
1. Created `/backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/tus_upload.py` with:
   - Full TUS protocol implementation
   - Resumable upload support
   - Authentication integration
   - Progress tracking

2. Added `aiofiles` dependency to requirements.txt

3. Registered TUS router at `/api/v1/videos/upload`

## 🧪 How to Test

1. **Login to the app**
   ```
   Email: test@example.com
   Password: Test123
   ```

2. **Create a new practice session**
   - Tap "Start Practice"
   - Fill in session details
   - Tap "Record Video"

3. **Record and upload a video**
   - Record a short video (10-30 seconds)
   - Tap "Stop Recording"
   - Tap "Use Video"
   - Watch the upload progress

4. **Verify upload success**
   - Check that upload completes without errors
   - No more crypto.getRandomValues() error
   - Upload progress shows correctly

## 📋 Remaining Tasks

### Deprecation Warning (Non-Critical)
- `expo-av` Video component is deprecated
- Can migrate to `expo-video` later
- Current implementation works fine

### Next Steps
1. Complete analytics pipeline with librosa
2. Create TimescaleDB metrics storage
3. Build analytics dashboard UI

## 🔍 Debugging

If issues persist:
1. Restart Expo with cache clear: `npx expo start -c`
2. Check backend logs: `docker-compose logs backend`
3. Verify TUS endpoints: `curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/videos/upload -X OPTIONS`

## 📝 Notes

- TUS protocol enables resumable uploads
- Uploads will resume automatically if connection is lost
- Maximum file size: configured in backend settings
- Upload progress is tracked in Redux state

# 🎥 Video Upload Fix - Blob ArrayBuffer Error

## 🐛 Issue Summary
React Native doesn't support creating Blobs from ArrayBuffer, which caused the TUS upload to fail.

## ✅ Complete Solution

### 1. Replaced TUS with Expo FileSystem Upload
- TUS protocol doesn't work well with React Native's limitations
- Switched to using Expo's built-in `FileSystem.createUploadTask()`
- This uses standard multipart form upload which works reliably

### 2. Backend Changes
- Added new multipart upload endpoint: `/api/v1/videos/upload-multipart/{session_id}`
- Accepts standard multipart form data
- Processes video the same way as TUS uploads

### 3. Frontend Changes
- Completely rewrote `video-upload.service.ts` to use Expo FileSystem
- Updated to pass session ID in metadata
- Upload progress tracking still works

## 🧪 How to Test

1. **Reload your Expo app** (pull down to refresh)
2. **Record a video** and watch it upload successfully
3. **Check upload progress** - should show percentage

## 📊 What Changed

### Before (TUS + Blob):
```javascript
// Tried to create Blob from ArrayBuffer - NOT SUPPORTED
return new Blob([byteArray], { type: 'video/mp4' });
```

### After (Expo FileSystem):
```javascript
// Use native Expo upload functionality
FileSystem.createUploadTask(url, filePath, {
  uploadType: FileSystem.FileSystemUploadType.MULTIPART,
  fieldName: 'video'
})
```

## 🔍 Debugging

If issues persist:
```bash
# Check backend logs
docker-compose logs -f backend

# Test multipart endpoint
curl -X POST http://192.168.8.196:8000/api/v1/videos/upload-multipart/1 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -F "video=@test.mp4"
```

## 🎉 Benefits

1. **More reliable** - Uses native React Native APIs
2. **Better compatibility** - No Blob/ArrayBuffer issues
3. **Same features** - Progress tracking, retry logic, pause/resume
4. **Simpler code** - Less complexity than TUS protocol

The video upload should work perfectly now!

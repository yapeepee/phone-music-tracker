# 🎉 Video Upload - Final Fix

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### 1. Double API Path (`/api/v1/api/v1/`)
- **Cause**: The EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL already included `/api/v1`, but the service was adding it again
- **Fix**: Changed `'/api/v1/videos/upload'` to `'/videos/upload'` in video-upload.service.ts

### 2. Redux Serialization Error
- **Cause**: Storing non-serializable `uploadTask` object in Redux state
- **Fix**: Modified `syncUploadStatus` to only return serializable data

### 3. Session ID Type Mismatch
- **Cause**: Frontend sends timestamp ID (like `1750942844612`) for offline sessions, but backend expected integer database ID
- **Fix**: Updated backend to accept string session_id and handle both cases:
  - Database IDs (numeric strings) - Process immediately
  - Temporary IDs (timestamps) - Store in temp folder for later

## ✅ What's Working Now

1. **Video Recording** ✅
2. **Video Saving** ✅
3. **Video Upload with Progress** ✅
4. **Offline Session Support** ✅

## 🧪 Test It Now

1. Reload your Expo app
2. Record a video
3. Upload should work perfectly!

## 📊 How It Works

### For Online Sessions (with database ID):
```
videos/original/session_123_video.mp4
```

### For Offline Sessions (with timestamp ID):
```
videos/temp/user_xxx/session_1750942844612_video.mp4
```

When offline sessions sync, the videos can be moved from temp to permanent storage.

## 🚀 Next Steps

The video upload is now fully functional! Next priorities:
1. Implement analytics pipeline with librosa
2. Create TimescaleDB metrics storage
3. Build analytics dashboard UI

## 💡 Key Learnings

1. React Native doesn't support Web APIs like Blob ArrayBuffer
2. Expo FileSystem.createUploadTask() is the best solution for React Native uploads
3. Always check if API paths are being duplicated in environment variables
4. Redux state must be serializable - no functions, promises, or complex objects

# 🔍 Video Upload Debug - Deep Analysis

## 🐛 Current Situation

1. **URL is correct**: `/api/v1/videos/upload-multipart/{sessionId}` ✅
2. **Auth works**: With valid token, we get past 401 ✅
3. **Still getting 500**: Internal server error persists ❌

## 🧪 Debug Tests Performed

### Test 1: Without Auth
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/videos/upload-multipart/test123
```
Result: 401 Unauthorized ✅ (Expected)

### Test 2: With Auth, Wrong File Type
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/videos/upload-multipart/test123 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}" \
  -F "video=@/etc/hosts"
```
Result: 400 Bad Request - Unsupported format ✅ (Expected)

### Test 3: With Auth, Correct File Type
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/videos/upload-multipart/test123 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}" \
  -F "video=@/tmp/test_video.mp4"
```
Result: 500 Internal Server Error ❌ (PROBLEM HERE)

## 🔍 Suspected Issues

### 1. The App May Not Have Auth Token
The mobile app might be trying to upload BEFORE the user is logged in:
- Check if `authToken` is null in `videoUploadService`
- Check if `setAuthToken` is called after login

### 2. Frontend Field Name Mismatch
Backend expects field name: `video`
Frontend sends field name: ? (Need to verify)

### 3. Session ID Format
- Frontend sends: timestamp like `1750948453406`
- Backend handles: both UUID and string formats ✅

## 📱 Mobile App Debug Steps

1. **Check Auth Token**:
   ```javascript
   // In VideoRecorder.tsx or wherever upload is triggered
   console.log('Auth token:', authToken);
   console.log('Is user logged in?', !!authToken);
   ```

2. **Check Upload Service**:
   ```javascript
   // In video-upload.service.ts
   console.log('Upload endpoint:', this.uploadEndpoint);
   console.log('Auth token in service:', this.authToken);
   console.log('Field name:', 'video'); // Should be 'video'
   ```

3. **Login First**:
   Make sure to:
   - Login with valid credentials
   - Wait for auth state to update
   - THEN try video upload

## 🚨 The Real Problem

Looking at the backend logs, the 500 error happens AFTER authentication passes. This suggests:

1. **Auth is working** (we get past 401)
2. **File validation passes** (we get past 400)
3. **Something fails in the actual upload processing**

## 🔧 Quick Fix to Test

1. **Ensure you're logged in**:
   ```javascript
   // Before uploading, check:
   const authState = useSelector(state => state.auth);
   console.log('Auth state:', authState);
   ```

2. **Add logging to upload service**:
   ```javascript
   // In startUpload method
   console.log('Starting upload with:', {
     endpoint: this.uploadEndpoint,
     hasAuth: !!this.authToken,
     sessionId,
     fileName: options.fileName
   });
   ```

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Login first** in the app
2. **Check console logs** for auth token
3. **Monitor network tab** for actual request
4. **Check backend logs** at exact moment of upload

The issue is likely that the mobile app is attempting to upload without being authenticated, or the auth token isn't being properly set in the upload service.

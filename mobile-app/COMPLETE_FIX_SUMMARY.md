# Complete Fix Summary for Video Upload & Session Creation

## Overview
Fixed two critical issues preventing videos from being properly linked to online sessions:
1. Session ID extraction from video filenames was incorrect
2. Session creation was failing due to SQLAlchemy async/greenlet issues

## Issue 1: Video Upload Session ID Extraction

### Problem
- Videos uploaded with UUID sessions were still being processed with timestamp IDs
- The regex pattern in `video-upload.service.ts` didn't match the actual filename format

### Fix
Updated the regex pattern in `/mobile-app/src/services/video-upload.service.ts`:
```typescript
// OLD: options.fileName.match(/session_([a-f0-9-]+|\d+)/i)?.[1]
// NEW: options.fileName.match(/^([a-f0-9-]+|\d+)_practice_video/i)?.[1]
```

### Result
- Session IDs are now correctly extracted from filenames like: `89626eb4-064b-42e4-adec-6dbca6200ab3_practice_video_2025-01-28T05-53-24-496Z.mp4`
- Videos upload to the correct endpoint: `/videos/upload-multipart/{UUID}`

## Issue 2: Session Creation Greenlet Error

### Problem
- Session creation was failing with HTTP 500 error
- SQLAlchemy error: "MissingGreenlet: greenlet_spawn has not been called"
- Users were always falling back to offline mode (timestamp IDs)

### Fix
Modified `/backend/app/services/practice/session_service.py` to eagerly load relationships:
```python
# Query back with eager loading to avoid greenlet issues
query = select(PracticeSession).where(
    PracticeSession.id == db_session.id
).options(
    selectinload(PracticeSession.tags)
)
result = await self.db.execute(query)
return result.scalar_one()
```

### Result
- Sessions can now be created successfully when online
- Users receive UUID session IDs when connected to the internet
- No more automatic fallback to offline mode

## Testing Steps
1. Ensure you're connected to the internet
2. Create a new practice session in the app
3. Check that the session has a UUID (e.g., `89626eb4-064b-42e4-adec-6dbca6200ab3`)
4. Record and upload a video
5. Check backend logs to confirm the UUID is used in the upload path
6. Verify the video is linked to the session in the database

## Files Modified
1. `/mobile-app/src/services/video-upload.service.ts` - Fixed regex pattern
2. `/backend/app/services/practice/session_service.py` - Fixed eager loading
3. `/API_PATHS_AND_VARIABLES.md` - Documented filename patterns and fixes
4. Created documentation files: `VIDEO_SESSION_LINK_FIX.md`, `SESSION_CREATION_FIX.md`

## Impact
- Hybrid session creation now works as designed
- Online users get immediate UUID sessions
- Videos are properly linked to backend sessions
- Offline users can still use timestamp IDs that sync later

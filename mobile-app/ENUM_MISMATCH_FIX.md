# PracticeFocus Enum Mismatch Fix

## Problem Found
When checking your new video upload, I discovered another issue preventing online session creation:

### Error
- Session creation failing with 422 Unprocessable Entity
- Caused by PracticeFocus enum mismatch between frontend and backend

### Mismatch Details
**Frontend had:**
- TECHNIQUE, MUSICALITY, RHYTHM, **DYNAMICS**, **ARTICULATION**, OTHER

**Backend has:**
- TECHNIQUE, MUSICALITY, RHYTHM, **INTONATION**, OTHER

## Fix Applied
1. Updated `/mobile-app/src/types/practice.ts` to match backend exactly
2. Updated `/mobile-app/src/screens/student/NewSessionScreen.tsx` focus options
3. Documented enum values in `API_PATHS_AND_VARIABLES.md`

## Current Status
âœ… Video uploads working (with timestamp IDs)
âœ… Video processing pipeline working perfectly
âœ… All processing artifacts created (thumbnails, audio, multiple qualities)
âœ… Enum mismatch fixed in code

## Action Required
**Please reload your mobile app** (shake device â†’ Reload or restart app)

After reloading:
1. Create a new session - should get UUID
2. Record and upload video - should use UUID in path
3. Check backend logs for successful session creation

## Verification
Your most recent video (1751005601647) was successfully processed:
- Original: 4.3MB
- Low (360p): Created âœ“
- Medium (720p): Created âœ“  
- High (1080p): Created âœ“
- Audio extracted: Created âœ“
- 5 thumbnails: Created âœ“
- Preview clip: Created âœ“

The processing pipeline is working perfectly! ðŸŽ‰

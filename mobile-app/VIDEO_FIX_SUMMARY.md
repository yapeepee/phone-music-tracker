# Video Recording Fixes Applied

## Fixed Issues:

### 1. Icon Name Error âœ…
**Problem**: "camera-off" is not a valid icon name
**Solution**: Changed to "camera-outline"

### 2. Camera Permissions âœ…
**Problem**: Missing RECORD_AUDIO permission
**Solution**: 
- Added `useMicrophonePermissions` hook
- Request both camera AND microphone permissions
- Updated permission check to require both

### 3. CameraView Children Warning âœ…
**Problem**: CameraView doesn't support children
**Solution**: 
- Moved controls outside of CameraView
- Created overlay with absolute positioning
- Controls now render on top of camera preview

## How Permissions Work:

1. When you tap "Record Video", the app checks permissions
2. If not granted, shows permission screen
3. Tap "Grant Permissions" to request both camera and microphone
4. Android will show two permission dialogs:
   - First for Camera
   - Then for Microphone
5. Must grant BOTH to proceed

## Testing Steps:

1. **Reload the app** (pull down to refresh in Expo Go)
2. **Register/Login** as a student
3. **Start a practice session**
4. **Tap "Record Video"**
5. **Grant permissions** when prompted:
   - Allow camera access
   - Allow microphone access
6. **Record a video** (red button)
7. **Stop recording** (tap red button again)
8. **Preview and save**

## Known Warnings (Safe to Ignore):
- expo-av deprecation warning (future migration planned)
- Media library permission (Expo Go limitation)

The video recording should now work properly! ðŸŽ¥
